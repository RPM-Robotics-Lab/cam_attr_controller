// image_sync_t is used by libcam plugins to synchronize playback of a libcam
// log file with playback of an LCM log file.
//
// The expected usage scenario is when an image stream is recorded to a libcam
// log file, and a lcm-syncpub unit is in the libcam chain that publishes
// image_sync_t messages to an LCM network, where they may be logged to the
// an LCM logfile.
//
// Later, when playing back an LCM log file, the image_sync_t messages can be
// used by a libcam log playback unit to synchronize its playback of the
// libcam log file with the LCM log file.
//
// The existence of this message type is largely predicated on the notion that
// we may not always want full resolution image data in an LCM log file, and
// may instead store it in a dedicated libcam log file.
