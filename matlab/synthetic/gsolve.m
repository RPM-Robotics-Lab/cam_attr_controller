    % gsolve.m − Solve for imaging system response function
    % Given a set of pixel values observed for several pixels in several
    % images with different exposure times, this function returns the
    % imaging system’s response function g as well as the log film irradiance
    % values for the observed pixels.
    % Assumes:
    % Zmin = 0
    % Zmax = 255
    % Arguments:
    % Z(i,j) the pixel values of pixel location number i in image j
    % B(j) the log delta t, or log shutter speed, for image j
    % l lamdba, the constant that determines the amount of smoothness
    % w(z) the weighting function value for pixel value z
    
    % Returns:
    % g(z) is the log exposure corresponding to pixel value z
    % lE(i)is the log film irradiance at pixel location i
